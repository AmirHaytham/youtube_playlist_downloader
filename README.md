   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirHaytham/youtube_playlist_downloader.git
   cd youtube_playlist_downloader
   ```

2. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**

   The script requires Node.js to run. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

   npm install progress
   ```

4. **Download and Set Up `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`**

   `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are required for downloading and merging video and audio files.

   - **Download `yt-dlp`**:
     - Go to the [yt-dlp releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest) and download the `yt-dlp.exe` file.
     - Save `yt-dlp.exe` in a directory, such as `C:\yt-dlp\`.

   - **Download `ffmpeg`**:
     - Go to the [ffmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and download a Windows build (e.g., from gyan.dev).
     - Extract the downloaded ZIP file and locate `ffmpeg.exe` in the `bin` folder.
     - Move `ffmpeg.exe` to a directory, such as `C:\ffmpeg\`.

5. **Add `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` to Your Script**

   Open the script file (e.g., `downloadPlaylist.js`) and set the paths to `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` by updating the following lines with the correct paths:

   ```javascript
   const ytDlpPath = 'C:\yt-dlp\yt-dlp.exe'; // Path to yt-dlp
   const ffmpegPath = 'C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe'; // Path to ffmpeg

   This command will start the download process, showing progress for each video in the terminal.
